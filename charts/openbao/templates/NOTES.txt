Thank you for installing OpenBao!

Now that you have deployed OpenBao, you should look over the docs on using
OpenBao with Kubernetes available here:

https://openbao.org/docs/


Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}. To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ helm get manifest {{ .Release.Name }}

{{ if and (not .Values.global.tlsDisable) .Values.server.gateway.httpRoute.enabled }}
WARNING: Terminating TLS before reaching the OpenBao Server is not recommended
and may break things like certificate authentication. Prefer usage of `TLSRoute`.
